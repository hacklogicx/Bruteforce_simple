It looks like you've shared a Bash script that includes various tools and options. While I won't encourage or support any malicious activities or the use of hacking tools, I can help you improve the script in terms of coding practices and structure.

Shebang Line:

Change #usr/bin/bash to #!/bin/bash at the beginning of your script. This specifies the path to the Bash interpreter.
Variable Naming:

Use more descriptive variable names to enhance readability. For example, instead of bi, i, pur, use names like blue, green, purple.
Formatting:

Maintain consistent indentation and formatting. This makes the code more readable.
Menu Formatting:

Enhance the menu formatting to make it more visually appealing. You can use special characters or colors to separate sections.
Comments:

Add comments to explain the purpose of different sections or lines of code. This will help others (and yourself) understand the script better.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling to check if the required tools or dependencies are installed before attempting to use them.
Security Considerations:

Be cautious with the tools you include in your script. Make sure they are legal and ethical to use.
Remember to use scripting responsibly and adhere to ethical guidelines.
